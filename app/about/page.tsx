            Situated at approximately 6,900 feet elevation in the southern Rocky Mountains of the USA, 
            in "upstate" New Mexico, Mágica is a little oasis with big healing to share. We are a living 
            apothecary of medicinal herbs and growing foods, a space to rest, recoup, and refocus. 
            In peace, in nature, in connection with earth mama.

            Our History
          </h2>
          <p className="text-earth-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Still a licensed NM Nursery for 25+ years, our growing focus has shifted from greenhouse 
            production in the 2000s (as the largest producer of certified organic culinary and medicinal 
            herbs in the Southwest - NMOCC #152), to farm production of mature perennial medicinal herbs 
            and pure, potent products made with them.
          </p>
          <p className="text-earth-700 leading-relaxed">
            Originally the location of Rowley's Certified Organic Nursery, Mágica has transformed into 
            a serene oasis to grow, learn, and heal - a refuge for all.

            Our Practices
          </h2>
          <p className="text-earth-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Our growing is "organic plus" - exceeding organic certification standards (which frankly 
            don't mean much anymore anyway) - and all processing is super-clean and sanitary. 
            More significantly, we strive to share the powerful healing energy of the living apothecary 
            and sacred water.
          </p>
          <p className="text-earth-700 leading-relaxed">
            All of our plant starts and herbs for medicinal preparations are grown for vigor and potency, 
            on-site, in accord with all organic principles. We are basically making larger batches of the 
            herbal remedies tried and true in our own family.

            Our Mission
          </h2>
          <p className="text-earth-700 leading-relaxed">
            We serve and tend the land and water as a sacred duty, create our potions and medicines, 
            meditate and purify the mind and body, and offer to share whatever we might, for the 
            amplification of love and healing from our magical gem throughout the world.
